This is version 16.0.1 of guava-libraries (Google core Java libraries,
http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/).

In order to prevent conflicts with user code which relies on Guava,
we've used jarjar (http://code.google.com/p/jarjar) to rebase this library.
The "com.google.common" package has been renamed to
"com.google.gwt.thirdparty.guava.common".

To build guava-16.0.1-rebased.jar:

1) Download guava-16.0.1.jar to guava-16.0.1

2a) Download jarjar from http://jarjar.googlecode.com/files/jarjar-1.4.jar

2b) Rebase guava-16.0.1.jar:
 <jarjar command> process guava-16.0.1.jarjar-rules guava-16.0.1.jar guava-16.0.1-rebased.jar

3) Clean up the resulting jar to remove META-INF:

   jar xvf guava-16.0.1-rebased.jar
   rm -rf META-INF/ 
   jar -Mcvf guava-16.0.1-rebased.jar com/google/gwt
